# DBLINK

DBLINK is basically a browser-based, money-management and space-war themed massively multiplayer online browser game.

I did this web browser game for multiple reasons, mainly because I wanted to develop my own web browser game and learn more about advanced web development. I always loved challenges and thinking about realtime data (in 2010 where no websocket nor html5 were implemented was challenging).

If you checked my github, you probably saw the "singleFramework" a MVC micro-framework developed in PHP by myself, this project is based on this framework. Maybe with some tweaks on it ..

This project was not a success in my opinion because I was a terrible developer, using terrible technologies to achieve my goals, but it works and people enjoyed playing on this website. At least 50 over 200 players.

I'm kind of proud of this project, even if the code is terrible, because I developed almost everything, maintain it for 2 years and even made some money to pay the server. Before judging, don't forget that many things in 2010 didn't exists yet or where still inaccessible. Moreover, I was in my second year of IT school and still learning many things. I'm obviously talking about proper backend / frontend separation, websocket (it was not the definitive RFC and php is a terrible interpreted language to use for this purpose) ...

I learnt a lot of things about advanced mysql, and was trying to do a maximum of things inside mysql to win time and performance. Check patch.sql, it's kind of interesting I think.
